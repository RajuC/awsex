# Awsex

This is an experiment to generate an Elixir AWS SDK using macros
and the AWS API spec from [botocore](https://github.com/boto/botocore).

## So far

Does not work.
Generates functions and structs from the AWS API json spec.

## Todo

- [x] Authentication
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Actual use
- [ ] Compile-time generation of typespecs (if this is even possible)
